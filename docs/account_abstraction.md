# Account Abstraction

Account abstraction is a powerful feature that allows you to convert regular wallets into smart contract wallets. This feature enables advanced functionalities like gas fee sponsorship, transaction bundling, session keys, and sophisticated recovery methods. With Dynamic, integrating account abstraction into your project is straightforward and offers significant benefits.

## Benefits of Account Abstraction

1. **Gas Fee Sponsorship:** You can allow your users to conduct “gasless” transactions, where the gas fees are sponsored by you, making the user experience smoother and more cost-effective.
2. **Transaction Bundling:** Collect a single signature from users for a bundle of transactions instead of asking for a signature for each individual action. This improves the user experience by reducing the number of interactions required.
3. **Session Keys:** Create session keys with specific permissions to execute transactions without requiring users to sign every time, even allowing transactions to occur while they are offline.
4. **Sophisticated Recovery Options:** Since the wallet is a smart contract, you can define advanced recovery methods for wallet signers, as well as transfer ownership between private keys.

## Getting Started with Account Abstraction

### Choosing an Account Abstraction Provider

Dynamic integrates with several account abstraction providers, allowing you to select the one that best suits your project’s needs. Currently supported providers include:
- **ZeroDev:** The only provider integrated natively into Dynamic.
- **Alchemy**
- **Pimlico**
- **Biconomy**

### Implementation Steps

1. **Set Up the Provider:** Begin by selecting your account abstraction provider. Each provider will have specific setup steps, but generally, you'll need to configure the provider's settings within your Dynamic project.
   
2. **Integrate with Dynamic:** Use the Dynamic SDK to link the smart contract wallet to your application. The SDK provides interfaces for managing wallets, handling transactions, and interacting with the smart contracts.
   
3. **Configure Smart Wallet Features:** Depending on your provider and project needs, configure features like gas sponsorship, session keys, or transaction bundling. Ensure that these configurations align with your user experience goals and security requirements.

### Code Examples

Below is an example of how to initialize a smart contract wallet using ZeroDev with Dynamic:

```javascript
import { DynamicContextProvider } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk';
import { ZeroDevSmartAccount } from '@dynamic-labs/providers';

<DynamicContextProvider
  settings={{
    environmentId: DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID,
    walletConnectors: [ZeroDevSmartAccount],
  }}
>
  ...
</DynamicContextProvider>
```

This code sets up a smart contract wallet using ZeroDev within the Dynamic environment. For more detailed implementations and advanced configurations, refer to the specific documentation of your chosen provider.
